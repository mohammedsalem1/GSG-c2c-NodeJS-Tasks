Task 6 – Create a Basic HTTP Server with JSON Response

📌 Your Task:

Build a simple HTTP server using the built-in http module in Node.js that can handle incoming requests and return responses in JSON format.

📎 Requirements:

Use the native http module (do not use Express or any external frameworks).

The server should listen on port 3000.

Handle at least two different routes:

GET / → return a JSON response like { message: "Welcome to the server" }

GET /about → return a JSON response like { message: "This is the about route" }

Set appropriate response headers (e.g., Content-Type: application/json)

Handle any unknown route with a 404 response: { error: "Route not found" }

📄 Submission Format:
  Publish your code into a Github repository.  

🎯 Goal:
Understand the basics of creating and managing an HTTP server manually in Node.js, and how to send/receive structured JSON responses.
